      "Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\n",
      "conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\n",
      "tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\n",
      "Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\n",
      "discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\n",
      "tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\n",
      "pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\n",
      "the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\n",
      "you're completely restricting your blood flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\n",
      "then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\n",
      "nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\n",
      "load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\n",
      "things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\n",
      "and the cycle continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\n",
      "your nerves.  They need blood too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\n",
      "for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\n",
      "relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\n",
      "ergonomics, only make things worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n",
      "\n",
      "(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\n",
      "injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\n",
      "less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\n",
      "occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\n",
      "cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\n",
      "to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\n",
      "inflamed, and you've got your problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\n",
      "can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\n",
      "and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\n",
      "swelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\n",
      "a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\n",
      "with repetitive activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\n",
      "fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\n",

      "CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\n",

      "\n",

      "If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\n",

      "\n",
      "There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\n",
      "inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\n",
      "posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\n",
      "your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\n",
      "and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\n",

      "available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \n",
      "significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \n",
      "and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \n",
      "unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \n",
      "Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \n",
      "be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \n",

      "\n",
      "There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease \n",
      "independently of its ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at \n",
      "the National Institues of Health. \n",
      "\n",
      "They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling \n",
      "skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the \n",
      "HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \n",
      "immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \n",
      "itself caused the skin disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \n",
      "without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \n",
      "National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \n",
      "described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \n",
      "Retroviruses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \n",
      "animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \n",
      "problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \n",
      "HIV as well as their own genetic material. \n",
      "\n",
      "NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \n",
      "eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \n",
      "contained both normal and transgenic animals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \n",
      "genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \n",
      "after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \n",
      "incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \n",
      "necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \n",
      "lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \n",
      "skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n",
      "\n",
      "Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \n",
      "type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \n",
      "cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \n",
      "animals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \n",
      "presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \n",
      "on,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \n",

      "infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \n",
      "systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \n",
      "skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \n",

      "soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \n",
      "the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \n",
      "the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \n",
      "been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \n",
      "Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \n",
      "Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \n",
      "of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \n",
      "malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \n",
      "control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \n",
      "resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \n",
      "salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \n",
      "infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \n",
      "in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \n",
      "minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \n",
      "emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \n",
      "effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n",
      "(3). \n",

      "     A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that \n",

      "asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment.  \n",
      "     The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits \n",
      "for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.  \n",
      "The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed \n",
      "unsafe under federal air quality laws.  \n",
      "     \"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to \n",

      "Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \"When people are on \n",
      "the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over \n",
      "the edge.\" \n",
      "     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits \n",
      "with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \n",
      "of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because \n",
      "they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \n",
      "compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \n",
      "exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n",
      "     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \n",
      "levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \n",
      "microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \n",

      "may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \n",

      "air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \n",
